# VIPER iOS Project

## Overview
This iOS project implements the VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) architectural pattern, which is a clean architecture approach for building iOS applications. The VIPER pattern helps in creating more maintainable, testable, and scalable applications by enforcing separation of concerns.

## Architecture
The project follows the VIPER architecture with the following components:

- **View**: Responsible for displaying data and sending user actions to the Presenter
- **Interactor**: Contains the business logic of the application
- **Presenter**: Contains view logic for preparing content for display and reacting to user inputs
- **Entity**: Contains basic model objects used by the Interactor
- **Router**: Handles navigation logic between different modules
